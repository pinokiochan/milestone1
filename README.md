# MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap

# Implementations
### This repository provides implementations of fundamental data structures: MyArrayList, MyLinkedList, MyStack, MyQueue, and MyMinHeap. These implementations mirror the functionality of the corresponding classes in the Java standard library.

# MyArrayList
### MyArrayList is a dynamic array data structure that resizes as elements are added or removed.

# MyLinkedList
### MyLinkedList is a doubly-linked list data structure supporting insertion, removal, and element access operations.

# MyStack
### MyStack implements the stack data structure, offering push, pop, and peek operations.

# MyQueue
### MyQueue implements the queue data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

# MyMinHeap
### MyMinHeap provides a min heap data structure with methods for adding, removing, and accessing the minimum element.

# Testing
### Execute the Main class to test the functionality of the implementations, demonstrating various operations.

# MyList Interface
### The MyList interface extends Iterable and defines methods for list manipulation, including adding, removing, sorting, and searching.

# Conclusion
### These implementations offer alternatives to Java's standard library classes and serve as educational tools for understanding data structure implementations.
